## Dice Face Mapping

Because `dice-box` only (currently) supports numeric mapping of dice faces the following [magic numbers](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)>) have been chosen for die faces.

- 1: success
- -1: failure
- 3: advantage
- -3: threat
- 7: triumph
- -7: despair
- 4: advantage + success
- -4: failure + threat
- 2: double success
- -2: double failure
- 6: double advantage
- -6: double threat
